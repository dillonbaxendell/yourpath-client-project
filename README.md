# Your Path

## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

Your Path is a local business that is advocating for recovery-oriented care and treatment for those on the road to recovery. Their previous workflow for matching patients with providers was using an excel spreadsheet and a significant amount of manual work - with this application they are able to completely automate that process!

## Installation

- Create a database named your_path,
- The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables that you will need to have this app work correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. I would recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries.
- Open up your editor of choice and run an "npm install"
- Run "npm run server" in your terminal.
- Open a section terminal and run "npm run client"
- A broswer should open automatically at localhost:3000 - enjoy the app!
